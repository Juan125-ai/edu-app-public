Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data. 
Instead of being explicitly programmed, these systems use algorithms to identify patterns and make decisions. 
There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data. 
Reinforcement learning involves training agents to make sequences of decisions by rewarding desired behaviors.
